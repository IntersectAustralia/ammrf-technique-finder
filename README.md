# ammrf-technique-finder
Technique finder is a web application with a researcher oriented language that enables microscopy and microanalysis laboratories to advertise instruments focusing on imaging research techniques rather than instrument specific lingo. It was developed for the [AMMRF](http://www.ammrf.org.au/) by [Intersect](http://www.intersect.org.au/), and funded by [NeAT](http://ands.org.au/neat-projects.html).
